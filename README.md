## Summary: 

This app was created for a game store that recently opened up and needs a program that is able to organize their products so that customers can purchase and search different games in an effective way. In order to achieve this goal, the games have to be organized so that customers are able to find them easily and put them in their basket. In addition, the time of purchase has to be the most efficient, meaning the queue should take a few minutes.

In addition, you can find all documentation of this app [here](https://github.com/Jacobo0312/AED-T1/tree/main/docs).
